## Alfred Extension for Modal File Manager

This is an extension to [Modal File Manager](https://github.com/raguay/ModalFileManager): a file manager with modal keyboard commands similar 
Vim. This extension will set the `normal` keymap command 'a' to open the current entry in the file 
manager (a directory or a file) to Alfred to show in the browser. Then you can use Alfred to run 
actions on that item.

This extension is for macOS only since Alfred is only on macOS. This is also for the Wails 2 version of Modal File Manager.
